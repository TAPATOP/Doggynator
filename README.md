# Doggynator
Akinator- style project

The goal of this project is to implement an Expert System that builds up a Knowledgebase through dialogue with the player. The original idea was for it to work for dog breeds or animals, but it can technically work for any sort of data, as long as you structure it in the form of questions that you would answer with "yes", "no" and "I don't know/ irrelevant"

Using the system is fairly simple. It has a simplified console interface, consisting of a menu with three options: "1. Play", "2. Add a Question" and "3. Exit", which are accessed by inputting the number in front of their names. Playing the game itself is fairly similar with the only difference there is something like a dictionary of allowed wods to respond with.

When it comes to installation, I don't believe there was anything specific about it- I don't use external libraries, frameworks and so on.
